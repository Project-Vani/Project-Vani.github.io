I"ƒ<p>India is a country known for its unity in diversity. The NorthEastern states of India, commonly called the â€˜seven sistersâ€™, are home to more than 200 languages, many of which are shrinking for want of documentation and active users.</p>

<p><strong>Vernacular Archive of Northeast India</strong> - <strong>VANI</strong> for short - is an initiative aimed at documentation, digitization and development of technology tools for the vernacular languages of the Northeast India.</p>

<p>VANI has a vision of rejuvenating vernacular languages with the aid of technology so that the richness of cultural diversity is cherished and humanity, at large, is benefitted.</p>

<p>This project is a non-profit venture, powered by passion and enthusiasm of language lovers. For more details about the core team and the contributors, visit our <a href="https://projectvani.org/team/">teamâ€™s page</a>.</p>
