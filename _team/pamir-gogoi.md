I am a PhD student at the Department of Linguistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.  My area of specialization is Phonetics and Phonology, focused on nasality and voice quality, interaction of source and filter properties in speech. I am also a Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning enthusiast.I am currently working on interaction of voice quality and nasality, nasalization in Hindi and acoustic analysis of some cross-linguistically rare sounds in some Tibeto-Burman languages of North-East India. Apart from that, I love tennis and cats!
