I am a PhD graduate in Linguistics from University of Florida, Gainesville. My area of specialization is Acoustic Phonetics and my research has mostly focused on acoustics of voice quality and nasality. I am also a Language Technology enthusiast and have always been interested in working for low-resource languages. Apart from that, I love tennis and cats!
